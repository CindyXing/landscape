# Landscape

## Edge Computing Landscape

The intent is for the Landscape to be a living document that developers, investors, vendors, researchers and others can use as a resource. See a gap in our landscape map? Hear of a new company or project relevant to the space? We encourage members of the community to open a an issue and contribute to the landscape map.
